# Database Build Tasks (typically empty for database services)
# Database services usually don't require build steps as they are pre-compiled
# Any database-specific initialization or migration tasks would go here

# Example: If you had database migration scripts, you could run them here
# - name: Run database migrations
#   shell: some-migration-command
#   when: migration_files_exist.stat.exists
