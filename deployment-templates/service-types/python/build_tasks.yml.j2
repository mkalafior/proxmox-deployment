# Python Build Tasks (typically empty for Python applications)
# Python applications usually don't require build steps as they are interpreted
# Any Python-specific compilation or preparation tasks would go here

# Example: If you had Python C extensions to compile, you could add them here
# - name: Compile Python extensions
#   shell: python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#   args:
#     chdir: "{{ app_dir }}"
#   become_user: "{{ app_user }}"
