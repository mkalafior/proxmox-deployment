# Placeholder for service-specific build tasks
# This file will be replaced by the merging system with the actual service-specific tasks
# Examples of what might go here:
# - TypeScript compilation for Node.js
# - Python wheel building
# - Go binary compilation
# - Asset compilation for static sites
# - Database schema migrations

# This is a placeholder and should never be executed directly
